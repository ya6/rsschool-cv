I have been doing work related to printing and outdoor advertising production.

In spare time, since 2017, I have been studying web technologies,

naturally I go in the direction of development related to printing and advertising.

In development, I mainly used ready-made layouts, modifying them for myself.

An example of development on JS is a script for marking a picture of a photo wallpaper with a wall size, you can see it here [here](https://stock-up.by/wallpaper).
